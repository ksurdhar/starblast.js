chase something without hitting other objects

these objects appear momentarily before disappearing - could be one of the stars at random
as you collect these your ship's color changes, could blink
screen inverts dramatically when you collect three


collect powerups without colliding
collect 3, ghost mode occurs
5 second time limit on ghost mode
asteroids grow larger and faster as they decrease in number




every 10 seconds, select one star at random to be powerup for 5 seconds
requires a powerup boolean on star object
if powerup, change color // eventually pulse

if ship collides with star that powerup equals true
add to powerLevel, change ship color // get ship to pulse

if ship collides with an asteroid, powerlevel should go down
